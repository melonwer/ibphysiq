# ðŸ¤– Meet Your AI Physics Tutor!

## What Is This AI Model?

Hi there! This is a special AI that's been trained specifically to help IB Physics students like you. Think of it as a super-smart tutor that never gets tired of creating practice questions.

**The Cool Technical Stuff:**
- **Brain Power:** 8 billion parameters (that's like having 8 billion tiny decision-makers!)
- **Training:** Built on Meta's Llama 3.1 and trained on thousands of IB Physics questions
- **Specialty:** Creating both Paper 1 (multiple-choice) and Paper 2 (long-answer) questions
- **Quality Check:** Every question gets refined by another AI to make sure it's accurate

## What Makes This AI Special?

### ðŸŽ¯ Perfect for IB Students
- **Curriculum Match:** Follows your exact IB Physics syllabus
- **Both Levels:** Works for Standard and Higher Level
- **Real Exam Style:** Questions feel just like your actual IB papers
- **Always Available:** Practice anytime, anywhere

### ðŸ“š How Teachers Use It
- Create quick practice sets for class
- Generate questions for homework assignments
- Build custom quizzes for different topics
- Help students who need extra practice

## ðŸ”¬ How We Trained This AI

### The Learning Process
We fed this AI a thousand of IB Physics questions from:
- Official IB curriculum documents
- Past exam papers (the good stuff!)
- Physics textbooks
- Questions reviewed by real IB teachers

### The Technical Training
- **Method:** LoRA fine-tuning (a smart way to teach AI without breaking it)
- **Time:** About 8 hours of intensive learning on powerful GPUs
- **Result:** An AI that "thinks" like an IB Physics teacher

## ðŸ“Š How Well Does It Work?

| What We Measured | Score | What This Means |
|------------------|-------|------------------|
| Physics Accuracy | 92% | Gets the science right almost every time |
| IB Curriculum Match | 89% | Questions fit your syllabus perfectly |
| Teaching Quality | 8.5/10 | Really helpful for learning |
| Language & Clarity | 9.1/10 | Easy to understand |

### Example Outputs

#### Multiple Choice Question
**Input:** "Generate a Paper 1 style question about electric circuits."

**Output:**
```
A student investigates the resistance of a wire using the circuit shown.

[circuit diagram description]

The current in the circuit is 0.50 A when the potential difference across the wire is 3.0 V. What is the resistance of the wire?

A) 0.17 Î©    B) 1.5 Î©    C) 6.0 Î©    D) 15 Î©

Answer: C) 6.0 Î©
```

#### Long Answer Question
**Input:** "Generate a Paper 2 style question about waves."

**Output:**
```
A transverse wave travels along a string. The wave can be described by the equation:

y = 0.05 sin(4Ï€x - 800Ï€t)

where y is in meters, x is in meters, and t is in seconds.

a) Determine the amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and wave speed.
b) Sketch the wave at t = 0, showing clearly the displacement at x = 0.25 m.
c) The wave now travels into a medium where the wave speed is reduced to 200 m/s.
   Determine the new wavelength and frequency.
```
